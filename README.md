## Name: Leye oduola

My name is Leye oduola and i'm a software developer currently working an intership with a company called Jeeni. I completed a bootcamp with Makers to jumpstart and give me confidence in my abilty to pursue a career in tech. What i love about tech is that it is the future of the world and even seeing the changes right in front of our own eyes, and it is only just the beginning. It has endless oppertunites as it could be applied in any industry, I belive this is skill worth knowing and understanding as it gives a sense of empowerment the as you can bring your ideas to real life.

## Skills

I would say i am a good team player.

There was a situation where i was working and i could see a customer was being quite rude to one of the staff members. I could tell that my fellow staff members was very annoyed so I took the initiative and told my staff member to swap roles with me so i could handle that customers order so he dosen't have to deal with him,  which allowed my staff member to cool down and carry on being full productive for the day.
